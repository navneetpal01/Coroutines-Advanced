/**
 * A parent coroutine provides a scope for its children,
 * creating a structured concurrency relationship. This has key effects:
 * Context Inheritance:
 *
 *     Children inherit context from their parent, though they can override it.
 *     Parent Suspension: A parent waits until all children finish.
 *     Cancellation Propagation: Canceling a parent cancels its children.
 *     Error Propagation: A child's error destroys the parent.
 *
 * Unlike other coroutine builders,
 * runBlocking cannot be a child. It's always the root, starting the entire hierarchy. This differentiates it from other builders.
 */

/**
 * Suspending functions must be called from other suspending functions.
 *
 * Coroutine builders (except runBlocking) need a CoroutineScope. Builders can start other builders on their scope. This is how applications are structured.
 *
 * MainPresenter is common for Android. UserController is common for backend.

//Using Coroutine scope

/**
 * When working with suspending functions, you need a coroutine scope to manage asynchronous tasks,
 * but passing the scope as an argument isnâ€™t ideal. Instead, use the coroutineScope function.
 * It creates a coroutine scope within its lambda and returns the result of that lambda. For instance,
 * if you're loading user data and articles asynchronously, coroutineScope helps manage these tasks without manually
 * handling the scope. This function is essential for handling asynchronous code cleanly and will be explored in
 * detail in the chapter on coroutine scope functions.
 */

 * suspend fun getArticlesForUser(
 * userToken: String?,
 * ): List<ArticleJson> = coroutineScope {
 * val articles = async { articleRepository.getArticles() }
 * val user = userService.getUser(userToken)
 * articles.await()
 * .filter { canSeeOnList(user, it) }
 * .map { toArticleJson(it) }

/**
 * Kotlin coroutines are a powerful tool for asynchronous programming.
 * The basic concepts involve suspending functions, coroutine scopes, and builders.
 * While this knowledge is sufficient for most uses, there's much more to explore,
 * including context management, cancellation handling, exception handling, and testing.
